# JARVIS CRM — Final Audit, Fix, and Verification Report

Date: 2026-09-22

## 1. Executive summary

The attached repository, master prompt, `NOT_fixed_yet..pdf`, prior fix reports, architecture/rule files, backend, frontend, Alembic history, tests, configuration, and bundled support assets were inventoried and reviewed. The implementation was corrected in place; no second CRM architecture or duplicate source of truth was introduced.

The highest-risk defects fixed were:

- Existing duplicate pending follow-ups blocked `alembic upgrade head`.
- Follow-up presets were not fully authoritative end to end.
- Task/follow-up object authorization was inconsistent.
- Queue counts were recalculated in the browser instead of returned by the backend.
- Normal batch assignment could overwrite existing ownership.
- Imported/global-pulled leads could be silently assigned to the acting admin/uploader.
- Global People lacked company-registry-grade idempotency, projection uniqueness, and success-only quota accounting.
- Business-date calculations and call KPI sources differed across endpoints.
- Productivity included lifetime data and an Activity fallback instead of authoritative CallRecord telemetry.
- Product/purpose context was incomplete in manual lead creation and Telecaller Desk.
- Production Docker configuration contained source-controlled fallback secrets.

Current result:

- Backend: **50 tests passed**.
- Python compilation: **passed**.
- Frontend TypeScript + production build: **passed**.
- Frontend lint: **passed with warnings** (exit code 0).
- Clean SQLite migration from base to head: **passed**.
- Upgrade containing the exact duplicate-follow-up condition: **passed**; one row remained pending and the older row was preserved as cancelled.
- Real PostgreSQL migration and race testing: **NOT VERIFIED** because no PostgreSQL server, Docker, or `pg_isready` was available in the execution environment.

Production-readiness status: **CONDITIONALLY READY**. The corrected application and local automated checks are green. A staging PostgreSQL migration backup/restore rehearsal and concurrency suite remain required before production rollout.

## 2. Repository coverage and audit method

The repository was reviewed as a complete modular-monolith flow:

`migration → model → service → API/auth → frontend API → component/state → tests/deployment`

Inventory excluding generated `node_modules`, `dist`, and Python caches:

- 404 files inventoried in the working tree before release cleanup.
- 137 backend application Python files.
- 16 Alembic revisions.
- 38 frontend TypeScript/TSX/CSS source files.
- 50 backend tests after this work.
- Documentation, SQL, JSON/CSV/XLSX fixtures, images, PDFs, logs, local databases, and the screen recording were identified by type and role.

Text source/config/documentation files were statically inspected or traced through references. Binary files were inventoried as supporting artifacts; they were not treated as executable proof. Existing reports were used as leads, not as evidence of correctness. Runtime databases, logs, caches, uploads, `node_modules`, and build output are excluded from the clean deliverable ZIP.

## 3. Requirement matrix

| Phase | Status | Evidence / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Full audit | PASS | Full inventory, architecture/data-flow trace, prompt and prior reports reviewed. |
| 1 — Products & Services | PASS | Tenant-scoped CRUD, role checks, duplicate controls, active filtering, UI route, and lifecycle/tenant test. |
| 2 — Lead product + purpose | PARTIAL | Model/API/manual UI/desk/import resolver are wired. Manual context is tested; product/purpose import mapping lacks a dedicated end-to-end fixture test. |
| 3 — vCard | PASS | Existing authenticated, assignment, tenant, masking, headers, escaping, and audit behavior retained; regression test passes. |
| 4 — Follow-up invariant | PASS | Service upsert + partial unique DB index; legacy duplicates reconciled before index creation. |
| 5 — Presets | PASS | Backend persists tomorrow/3days/nextweek at org-local 09:00; none cancels; regression test passes. |
| 6 — History/max attempts | PARTIAL | Completed/cancelled tasks and reschedule history are preserved and policies enforce attempt limits. A dedicated maximum-cycle test is still missing. |
| 7 — Dedicated panel | PASS | Telecaller Desk reads the follow-up API and supports completion while showing context/history. Production build passes. |
| 8 — Fresh vs follow-up | PASS | Backend returns authoritative totals and disjoint typed items; UI consumes backend counts; regression test passes. |
| 9 — Tomorrow behavior | PASS | Active follow-up excludes the lead from fresh classification; persisted due dates survive subsequent reads. |
| 10 — Follow-up authorization | PASS | Generic and dedicated mutations share service authorization; both task assignment and lead ownership/delegation are checked. |
| 11 — Target engine | PASS | `TelecallerTarget` is authoritative; org/user/date uniqueness and exact 80/30/120 round-trip tested. |
| 12 — Business date | PARTIAL | Shared org-local date/bounds utility is used throughout corrected flows. Midnight-boundary behavior was not tested with a frozen clock. |
| 13 — Productivity source | PASS | Call totals/connects/talk time use `CallRecord`; Activity remains business history only. Date range is org-local. |
| 14 — Shift lifecycle | PASS | Server timestamps, refresh status, duplicate start guard, break closure, and end behavior tested. |
| 15 — Assignment | PASS | Eligible active telecaller/shift checks, row locks, skip/report for owned leads, explicit reassignment, and assignment history. |
| 16 — Absence/redistribution | PARTIAL | Delegated lead/task queues and auditable bulk reassignment are implemented; full absence transfer integration test is missing. |
| 17 — Global Company | PARTIAL | Transactional row locking, tenant projection, success-count quota, and masking were traced; PostgreSQL race behavior was not executable here. |
| 18 — Global People | PARTIAL | Added locks, idempotency, unique projection, target-owner validation, and success-only quota; functional test passes, PostgreSQL races unverified. |
| 19 — Imports | PARTIAL | File/path/role/owner/catalog validation and row errors corrected. Pipeline immutability test passes; dedicated product/purpose import fixture remains. |
| 20 — Communications | PARTIAL | Native dialer, WhatsApp helper, SMTP/Gmail paths and normalization exist; provider/device integration was not live-tested. No fake success was added. |
| 21 — Lead 360 context | PASS | Product, purpose, timeline, tasks, follow-ups, stage/assignment context flow through authorized APIs and UI. |
| 22 — EOD/productivity | PARTIAL | Backend records and org-local dates are authoritative; Celery worker/beat execution was not run in this environment. |
| 23 — Navigation/routing | PARTIAL | Products route/nav and build verified. Browser deep-link, mobile overflow, and visual responsiveness were not E2E-tested. |
| 24 — RBAC/tenant security | PASS | Tenant-derived context, IDOR checks, product/task/lead/global/import boundaries, and cross-tenant tests pass. |
| 25 — Migrations | PARTIAL | Ordering, clean SQLite upgrade, duplicate-data upgrade, indexes, and head verified. Real PostgreSQL upgrade/downgrade not available. |
| 26 — Concurrency | NOT VERIFIED | Correct row locks/unique constraints are present, but required PostgreSQL simultaneous-request tests need a real server. |
| 27 — API/frontend consistency | PASS | Queue counts, target values, business dates, and call KPIs use backend-authoritative contracts/sources. |
| 28 — Test suite | PARTIAL | 50 tests pass, including new critical regressions. The prompt’s complete PostgreSQL concurrency matrix is not executable here. |
| 29 — Build/test | PARTIAL | Pytest, compileall, npm build, TS validation, lint, and SQLite migrations ran. PostgreSQL validation remains outstanding. |
| 30 — Final re-audit | PASS | Re-traced changed flows, removed competing queue calculation, reran complete local checks. |

## 4. Strict acceptance scenarios

| Scenario | Status | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Product/purpose context | PASS | API regression creates Data Science Course and Telecaller sees product and purpose. |
| Fresh + follow-up disjointness | PASS | Backend-classified queue test confirms no dual classification. |
| Duplicate follow-up | PASS | Application upsert and DB unique index; legacy duplicate migration scenario passes. |
| Tomorrow preset | PASS | Org-local due date persisted at 09:00 and remains one active row. |
| Target 80/30/2h | PASS | Admin update and telecaller read return 80, 30, 120 minutes. |
| Asia/Kolkata boundary | PARTIAL | Shared timezone implementation is present; exact midnight clock simulation was not run. |
| No assignment stealing | PASS | Owned row is skipped/reported and retains its owner. |
| Global Company visibility | PARTIAL | API schemas omit puller identity and projections are tenant-scoped; 1,000-record live scenario not run. |
| Company quota partial success | PARTIAL | Service deducts successful claims; PostgreSQL concurrent partial batch not run. |
| People quota partial success | PASS | Duplicate + missing IDs charge one successful projection only; retry charges zero. |
| vCard authorization | PASS | Authorized and forbidden paths plus masking are covered by passing tests. |
| Shift refresh/end | PASS | Status endpoint returns persisted server state and end closes open break. |

## 6. Detailed implementation changes

### Follow-ups

- Lead/task rows are locked during authoritative follow-up changes.
- Active means `task_type='FOLLOW_UP' AND status='PENDING' AND lead_id IS NOT NULL`; a past due date does not create another task.
- Presets resolve in the organization timezone and upsert the active task.
- `none` cancels any current active task.
- Generic task and dedicated follow-up completion/reschedule share the same authorization service.
- Telecaller authorization checks task assignment, lead ownership, and active absence delegation.
- Existing duplicates are preserved as cancelled history rather than deleted.

### Queue and Telecaller Desk

- `/telecaller/queue/today` now returns `total`, `fresh_count`, `followup_count`, and typed `items`.
- A follow-up lead is excluded from the fresh list at the backend.
- Frontend badges consume backend counts.
- Dedicated follow-up data comes from `/followups`, not frontend-only filtering.
- Product/service and call purpose are shown in pre-call context.

### Targets, dates, calls, and shifts

- `TelecallerTarget` is the write/read source; legacy JSON is one-time migration compatibility only.
- Target creation, retrieval, dashboard, daily task, and reports use organization-local business dates.
- Call totals/connects/talk time use `CallRecord` consistently.
- Productivity is range-bounded and no longer falls back to Activity duration.
- Duplicate open shift creation is protected at application and DB levels; ending a shift closes an open break.

### Assignment/import/global registry

- Normal batch assignment locks and claims only unowned eligible leads, returns skipped count, and never silently steals.
- Explicit reassignment closes prior assignment history and appends a new record.
- Imports and global pulls do not silently assign leads to an admin/uploader; an explicit valid active telecaller is required for ownership.
- Import upload paths are user-scoped/sanitized and role/catalog boundaries are checked.
- Global People now has idempotent tenant projections, row locks, success-only quota accounting, and a partial unique index.
- Client-supplied organization IDs are ignored in tenant pull operations.

### Security/deployment

- Telecaller lists, activities, tasks, follow-ups, leads, product catalog, imports, targets, and registry actions enforce server-derived tenant/role context.
- Production Docker requires externally provided `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and 32+ character `SECRET_KEY`.

## 7. Tests added or updated

New/expanded regressions cover:

- Product create/deactivate/context/tenant isolation/telecaller mutation denial.
- Preset persistence, one-active-follow-up, no-follow-up, and CallRecord disposition.
- Backend queue counts and fresh/follow-up disjointness.
- Follow-up mutation denial for another owner.
- Exact target round trip and organization business date.
- Shift start/duplicate start/break/status/end persistence.
- Batch assignment skip/no stealing.
- Global People idempotency and successful-claim-only quota.
- New-organization fresh-state test made database-portable while preserving PostgreSQL-only schema checks.
- Assignment test moved off stale developer credentials/database and onto isolated fixtures.

## 8. Commands executed and results

From repository root unless shown otherwise:

```bash
python -m venv /tmp/jarvis-crm-venv
source /tmp/jarvis-crm-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python -m compileall -q backend/app backend/tests
pytest -q backend/tests
```

Result: **50 passed, 61 warnings**.

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
npm run lint
```

Result: build and TypeScript validation passed; lint exited 0 with warnings. Main generated JS chunk is approximately 1.54 MB before gzip.

```bash
cd backend
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/<clean-db>.sqlite alembic upgrade head
```

Result: clean upgrade reached `9f4c2b7d1e30`.

Duplicate-data reproduction:

1. Upgrade a clean database to `651077a665a1`.
2. Insert two pending follow-ups with the same organization/lead.
3. Run `alembic upgrade head`.

Result: newest row remained `PENDING`, older row became `CANCELLED` with the migration note, active count was 1, and head was `9f4c2b7d1e30`.

## 9. Deployment/migration runbook

Back up the PostgreSQL database first. Then, from `backend` with the intended environment loaded:

```bash
alembic current
alembic heads
alembic upgrade head
alembic current
```

Expected head:

```text
9f4c2b7d1e30
```

The command the operator originally used—`alembic upgrade head`—is correct. The prior failure was data incompatibility, not the command. The invariant migration now reconciles duplicate active follow-ups before creating `uq_active_followup_per_lead`.

For Docker Compose, set secrets before starting:

```bash
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD='<strong database password>'
export SECRET_KEY='<random value of at least 32 characters>'
docker compose up -d postgres redis
docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head
docker compose up -d
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `$env:POSTGRES_PASSWORD='...'` and `$env:SECRET_KEY='...'`.

## 10. Remaining known issues and environment limitations

1. **PostgreSQL verification:** no local PostgreSQL/Docker runtime was available. Run clean, existing-data, downgrade rehearsal, and all seven concurrency cases on staging PostgreSQL.
2. **Frontend warnings:** lint exits successfully but reports pre-existing unused imports, hook dependency/purity warnings, and similar cleanup items outside the critical CRM corrections.
3. **Backend deprecations:** tests emit Pydantic v2/FastAPI lifespan and dependency warnings. They do not fail current behavior but should be scheduled before future major upgrades.
4. **Bundle size:** Vite reports the main chunk above 500 kB; route/component code splitting is recommended.
5. **External integrations:** real SMTP/Gmail provider, telephony webhook/provider, WhatsApp device handoff, SMS provider, and mobile vCard import require configured staging credentials/devices.
6. **Worker verification:** Celery worker/beat automatic EOD execution was not launched.
7. **Browser E2E:** responsive navigation, deep links, refresh UX, and device contact-import UX were build-verified but not browser/device automated.
8. **Legacy diagnostic:** `backend/audit_all_endpoints.py` assumes a seeded environment and a current external database; it is not an isolated release test. The pytest suite is the reproducible local verification source.

## 11. Required staging gate

Before production deployment:

1. Restore a production-like backup into staging PostgreSQL.
2. Run `alembic upgrade head` and verify head plus duplicate reconciliation counts.
3. Run the prompt’s seven simultaneous-request concurrency cases.
4. Run browser E2E for the 12 strict acceptance scenarios.
5. Start worker and beat, then verify EOD generation.
6. Smoke-test configured email, telephony, WhatsApp, and vCard flows.

Until those steps pass, PostgreSQL concurrency and live integration claims must remain **NOT VERIFIED/PARTIAL**, as classified above.
